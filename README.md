## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Mohit, a frontend design engineer based in India.

I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code and Figma, youâ€™ll find me watching anime, hitting the gym, or drawing. I also enjoy writing blog posts and sharing tech-related content on social media.

## Fun Facts:
I donâ€™t like coffee or tea. 
Traveling is my favorite hobby.

### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Mohit**](https://mohitbisen.netlify.app/), a design engineer based in I.

I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code and Figma, you’ll find me watching anime, hitting the gym, or drawing. I also enjoy writing [blog posts](https://www.instagram.com/mohit._.bisen?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=MWQ2cTllbjdhZTQ3OQ==) and sharing tech-related content on social media.

#### Fun Facts:

* I don’t like coffee or tea.
* Traveling is my favorite hobby.

#Hi there! 
I’m Mohit, a frontend design engineer based in India.

I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code and Figma, you’ll find me watching anime, hitting the gym, or drawing. I also enjoy writing blog posts and sharing tech-related content on social media (over 160K combined followers and counting).

#Fun Facts:
I don’t like coffee or tea.
Traveling is my favorite hobby.
